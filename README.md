# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2 - Team Purple
Michael MacInnis, Victoria Ro, Harrison Lee, Luis Herran

This is a group project and hence collaborative code. We also utilized the XLA and ChatGPT AGIs for assistance.

This codebase contains the following deliverables in the subdirectory "Starter_Files": 

1. A Jupyter Notebook, "ETL_Mini_Project_*" where the wildcard at the end has short form names of the group members.

2. In the "Resources" subdirectory : new CSV files "category", "subcategory", "campaign" and "contacts" that contain the respective DataFrames.
These can eventually be used to import into a SQL database.

NOTE that the "campaign" CSV should be imported into the database LAST. 
The others can be imported in any order.

4. a file "crowdfunding_db_schema.sql" which can be imported into Postgres to create a SQL database
based on the created CSV files included.

5. crowdfunding_schema_image.PNG, a PNG picture of the ERD showing the database structure and relations.

6. a screenshot of the SELECT statements required to prove that the database tables have the correct information in them.

We believe the code uploaded answers all challenges presented on the Canvas page.

Prosit!
